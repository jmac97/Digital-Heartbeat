# Digital-Heartbeat
Kit of my heart
Instructions on making the Guy to attach or embed in whatever you want!


## If you got a kit
You guys don't have soldering irons and what not so everything is attached, coded, and ready to go! To attach the motor, remove the sticker on the back of the motor and just stick it on something. To power it on, pop in whatever battery I gave you. There is no on/off switch because I ran out, whoops! To see a more in depth way to attach it to fabric, scroll down to the "Ok What Now" section.

## Ok but you didn't give me anything
Sorry I still love you I just ran out of stuff (hence lack of switches in the kits). Here's how to make everything from scratch.

### Parts
Just double check I didn't forget anything lol

1. Vibration Motor
2. Arduino Pro Trinket with Battery Attachment
3. LiPoly Battery
4. Micro USB Cable
5. Switch
6. Heat Shrink Tubing

Optional
1. Pouch (for putting it inside soft objects)
2. 0.1uF Capacitor 
3. 1K Ohm Resistor
4. 1N4001
5. 2N2222
6. Protoboard
7. Solder & Soldering Iron

### Soldering the Motor Wires
Solder on extra length of wire to the negative and positive wires of the motor to give them extra length. Heat shrink each side and then heat shrink both wires together.

</p>

### Wire Up The Motor 
Twist the ends of the wires so you can thread them into the holes in the lil Arduino. Then, put the black wire through the bottom left corner hole and the red wire into any hole with a " ~ " next to the number. For example, the motor below is hooked up to ~5. Look at the image below for guidance, but do a cleaner job with the ends of the wires:

### Hold Up
"Hey aren't you supposed to have circuitry for the motor?"

Yes, technically, thank you. As it is now, the motor isn't getting as much ~juice~ and thus isn't vibrating as strongly as it could be. This is fine for most things since it's small motor inside a soft object, but if you wanted to add more "hearts" like I did or put the motor onto something less flexible, then you will want to do the following circuit on your protoboard:

</p>

### Optional: Adding Power Switch
To add a power switch, cut the black wire of the battery and solder each end to a terminal on the switch. The two terminals you pick don't matter, but make sure they are next to each other.

</p>

### Test
Plug the battery into the black terminal ontop of the Arduino. Things should light up and there should be a red flashing light. Once that stops, the motor should be gently vibrating.

## Ok What Now
So you can either shove everything (except the motor) into a pouch with some stuffing and sew that up OR mount it onto the back of an embroidery thing. 

### Into the Pouch
This is pretty simple like I said shove everything into the pouch but leave the motor and wires out. To stitch everything up, use a ladder stich. I would tell you how to do this but I am very bad at it so just Google.

</p>

### Mounting
For the board, use the screw holes to sew it in place. Too loops for each hole is fine.

For the motor, first undo the white sticker bit on the back, then place it where you want it to go. Sew as close to the neck of the motor as possible. I dig the needle a bit under the neck. Keep it really tight. A couple of loops works.
