# Digital-Heartbeat
Kit of my heart


## Hello Friends
Here are the instructions on making the Guy to attach or embed in whatever you want! Everything is attached and ready to go. The fist section applies only to people who are NOT Katie. If you are Katie, skip to the section that says "KATIE!!!"

## This is the Beginning of the Non-Katie Part
Hello Not-Katies. 
You guys don't have soldering irons and what not so everything is attached, coded, and ready to go! To attach the motor, remove the sticker on the back of the motor and just stick it on something. To power it on, pop in whatever battery I gave you. There is no on/off switch because I ran out, whoops! To see a more ~in depth~ way to attach it to things, scroll down to the "Ok What Now" section.

## KATIE!!!
You may begin here
## Parts
Just double check I didn't forget anything lol

1. Pouch
2. Vibration Motor
3. Arduino Pro Trinket with Battery Attachment
4. Battery

Those are the necessary bits, here are the optional things I should've included as well:
1. Micro USB Cable
2. Switch
4. Stuffing
5. Wire Strippers


## Trim Wire Length 
Use some wire strippers to cut the wire length to your need.

## Wire Up The Motor 
Twist the ends of the wires so you can thread them into the holes in the lil Arduino. Then, put the black wire through the bottom left corner hole and the red wire in the hole labeled ~5. Look at the image below for guidance, but do a cleaner job with the ends of the wires:

"Hey I'm very smart and I see you're not using any additional circuitry on your 

## Optional: Adding Power Switch
To add a power switch, cut the black wire of the battery and solder each end to a terminal on the switch. The two terminals you pick don't matter, but make sure they are next to each other.

## Test
Plug the battery into the black terminal ontop of the Arduino. Things should light up and there should be a red flashing light. Once that stops, the motor should be gently vibrating. I didn't make it stronger like I did with my Guy but when I made Amandas this amount was fine and easier to work with.


## Ok What Now
So you can either shove everything (except the motor) into the pouch with some stuffing and sew that up OR mount it onto the back of an embroidery thing. 

### Into the Pouch
This is pretty simple like I said shove everything into the pouch but leave the motor and wires out. To stitch everything up, use a ladder stich. I would tell you how to do this but I am very bad at it so just Google.

### Mounting
For the board, use the screw holes to sew it in place. Too loops for each hole is fine.

For the motor, first undo the white sticker bit on the back, then place it where you want it to go. Sew as close to the neck of the motor as possible. I dig the needle a bit under the neck. Keep it really tight. A couple of loops works.
